Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
  -Probably nothing. Documentation like this is an serious weak point for me. 
What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
  -UML charts are particularly helpful. 
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
  -Probably the assignment I didn't do(due to illness/hospitalization.) I'd do the work.
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
  -I didn't. It's important because their wants/needs become requirements which are necessary for a great many things. 
How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
  -Personally, I approach software with a level of modularity and reuse in mind. 
  -A method creatLogFile would take in a path and file type as parameters and do the rest in the background. This has been particularly helpful in my field. 
  -I've also made a qLog and qDebug which take in colors and file paths as parameters. Long story short making things modular, 
      while might take longer in creation saves time in the long time if you can reuse it.
